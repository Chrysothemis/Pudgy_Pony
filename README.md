##  The Story
Pudgy Pony is tired of being made fun of by the other ponies! He may not be the best flyer, but he knows he can get higher than the others if he puts his mind to it!

##  How to Play
Pudgy Pony can't fly so well, so he needs to use the clouds to boost himself along.
You can walk atop and through clouds or jump through them to boost your jump height! 
Collect rainbows along the way for extra points.
Get to the next level by reaching the warp tornado!
